## Aisha's Amino Acid Hangman
I created a hangman game that allows you to guess the structure of an amino acid. Hangman was always one of my favorites so I started to think how can I make it unique. I thought of a few ideas and noticed, after a Google search, that there wasn’t a hangman on the amino acid structures. Since I was a chemistry major, I knew I had to fix this.
