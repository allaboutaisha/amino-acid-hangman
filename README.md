# Amino Acid Hangman
As someone with a strong background in chemistry and a love for the subject, I designed an educational hangman game that teaches players about amino acid structures. Hangman is a familiar game that many people enjoy playing, and by using this format to teach amino acid structures, I've created a fun and interactive way for players to learn. I invite you to start learning the amino acid structures and [try it out for yourself!](https://aminoacidhangman.netlify.app/)
